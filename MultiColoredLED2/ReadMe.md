# Arduino Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of Arduino experiments and learning projects!  
This repository explores different sensors, modules, and programming techniques ‚Äî from simple LED fades to more advanced interactive circuits.

## üß† Overview
Each folder in this repository contains a self-contained Arduino project with:
- Wiring details  
- Example code (`.ino` files)  
- Notes or documentation about the module used  
- Optional related videos and demos  

These projects are great for beginners looking to understand the basics of microcontrollers and for hobbyists experimenting with new ideas.
