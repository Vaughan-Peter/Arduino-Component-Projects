# Arduino LED Pattern Switcher with Push Button

This project uses an Arduino to control six LEDs connected to pins D8–D13. A 3-pin pushbutton module is connected to D2 to switch between two different LED patterns.

## 🔧 Components Used

- Arduino Uno (or compatible)
- 6 × LEDs
- 6 × 220Ω resistors
- 1 × 3-pin push button module
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## 🖥️ Circuit Setup

### Push Button Module
- **SIG (Signal)** → D2
- **VCC** → D3 (used as 5V output)
- **GND** → GND

### LEDs
- Connect 1 LED to each pin from D8 to D13
- Anode (long leg) → Arduino pin (via 220Ω resistor)
- Cathode (short leg) → GND

## 💡 Features

- Pattern 1: Chase effect (LEDs light up one at a time)
- Pattern 2: All LEDs blink together
- Push button toggles between the patterns
- Improved software debounce to avoid false triggers

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Connect the circuit as described above
2. Upload the `led_pattern_button.ino` sketch to your Arduino
3. Press the button to switch between LED patterns

## 📁 File

- `led_pattern_button.ino` — main Arduino sketch

## 🧠 Notes

- The button uses `INPUT_PULLUP`, so it reads `LOW` when pressed
- You can expand this project to include more patterns or use a rotary encoder instead of a button
