# Arduino LED Pattern Cycler

This Arduino project cycles through **four different LED lighting patterns** using a **push button**. It's ideal for learning digital input/output, button debouncing, and pattern-based logic.

## üß† Features

- Push button cycles through **4 LED patterns**
- Controls **6 LEDs** on digital pins D8 through D13
- Debounced input for smooth transitions
- Uses **D3 as power output** for the push button module
- Modular code using a separate header file
- Can be powered via **USB power bank** for portable use
